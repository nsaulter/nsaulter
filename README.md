- 👋🤙 Hi, I’m @nsaulter
- 👀💻 I’m interested in ALL things tech!  Or mostly lol.  My passion is design, but I really look forward to everything involved with web development.  I don't know what, if any, positions I'll hold in the future, but I am excited to be on this difficult journey.
- 🌱📚 I’m currently learning web development through the Odin Project.  In the past I've worked with HTML, CSS, video/audio proudction (PremPro, Aud, etc.),  WordPress, and Bitnami.
- 💞️🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involved with my web development training and hopefully eventually collaborting on projects that are part of my job.
- 📫📱 You can reach me at my email nathansaulter@gmail.com, on Twitter (@the2ndsaulter), or on my cell (just email or DM me to request).
